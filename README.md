# Quantifying competition between two demersal fish species from spatiotemporal stomach content data

This repo contains R code for analyzing diet and changes in spatial distribution of cod and flounder.

We use spatiotemporal linear mixed-effects models and a predictive-modeling framework within the R package [sdmTMB](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.24.485545) to biomass and diet data to quantify competition between cod and flounder in the Baltic Sea.

## How to replicate our analyses and navigate this repo

`data`
We use data collated in [Lindmark et al., 2023](https://github.com/maxlindmark/cod-condition)

`R`
Contains code for analysis and data processing

`figures`
Contains figures of results

`output`
Contains .rds objects of model outputs due to long computation times
