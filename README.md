# Quantifying competition between two demersal fish species from spatiotemporal stomach content data

This repo contains R code for evaluating competition between cod and flounder using diet data and spatiotemporal linear mixed-effects models using the R package [sdmTMB](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.24.485545).

We use  to biomass and diet data to quantify competition between cod and flounder in the Baltic Sea.
